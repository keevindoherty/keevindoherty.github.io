I'm a robotics researcher at <a href="https://bostondynamics.com">Boston Dynamics</a> where I work on perception and state estimation for the Atlas humanoid robot.

Previously, I completed my PhD at the <a href="http://www.mit.edu/">Massachusetts Institute
of Technology</a> in the <a href="http://aeroastro.mit.edu/">AeroAstro
department</a>, as part of the <a href="http://mit.whoi.edu/">MIT/WHOI Joint
Program</a>. At MIT, I was a member of the <a
href="http://marinerobotics.mit.edu/">Marine Robotics Group</a> in the <a
href="http://csail.mit.edu/">Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab
(CSAIL)</a>, where I was advised by <a
href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/john-leonard">John Leonard</a>.

My research interests are at the intersection of machine learning and autonomous robotic
navigation. I'm particularly interested in the algorithms and representations necessary to endow real robots with the ability to operate robustly over extended time horizons without human intervention, supported by active, lifelong learning. My research is funded in part by an <a
href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/">NSF Graduate Research Fellowship</a>.

In the past, I worked on distributed learning algorithms for underwater
exploration with application to biological surveying tasks. Before my PhD, I was
an undergraduate student at <a href="http://www.stevens.edu/">Stevens Institute
of Technology</a> where I did research on robot mapping in the <a
href="http://personal.stevens.edu/~benglot/">Robust Field Autonomy Lab</a> under
<a href="https://web.stevens.edu/facultyprofile/?id=2043">Brendan Englot</a>.
