I was a teaching assistant for <a href="https://learning-modules.mit.edu/class/index.html?uuid=/course/16/fa19/16.485#info">MIT 16.485 Visual Navigation for Autonomous Vehicles (VNAV)</a> in 2019, taught by <a href="https://lucacarlone.mit.edu">Prof. Luca Carlone</a> and <a href="http://www.mit.edu/~mrrobot">Dr. Kasra Khosoussi</a>. VNAV is an advanced course for graduate and undergraduate students, and covers everything from the theoretical foundations of vision-based 3D perception to the practical implementation of state-of-the-art visual navigation techniques. Key topics include visual-inertial navigation, place recognition, SLAM, and manifold geometry.
