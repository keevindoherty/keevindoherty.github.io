I"£<p>Iâ€™m a PhD student at the <a href="http://www.mit.edu/">Massachusetts Institute
of Technology</a> in the <a href="http://aeroastro.mit.edu/">AeroAstro
department</a>, as part of the <a href="http://mit.whoi.edu/">MIT/WHOI Joint
Program</a>. I am a member of the <a href="http://marinerobotics.mit.edu/">Marine Robotics Group</a> in the <a href="http://csail.mit.edu/">Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab
(CSAIL)</a>, where Iâ€™m advised by <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/john-leonard">John Leonard</a>.</p>

<p>My research lies at the intersection of machine learning and autonomous robotic
navigation. Iâ€™m particularly interested in two sorts of problems: achieving
robust machine learning on robotic systems to the benefit of navigation tasks,
and applying constraints imposed by the physical environment to aid in learning
on robots. My research is funded in part by an <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/">NSF Graduate Research Fellowship</a>.</p>

<p>Previously I worked on distributed learning algorithms for underwater
exploration with application to biological surveying tasks. Before that, I was
an undergraduate student at <a href="http://www.stevens.edu/">Stevens Institute
of Technology</a> where I did research on robot mapping in the <a href="http://personal.stevens.edu/~benglot/">Robust Field Autonomy Lab</a> under
<a href="https://web.stevens.edu/facultyprofile/?id=2043">Brendan Englot</a>.</p>
